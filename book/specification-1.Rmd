# Model specification 1 {#sec-specification-1}

```{r}
#| include: false
source(here::here("src/global.R"))
```


In this chapter, we'll code up a very simple pharmacokinetic model. 
This is just starter material to get some concepts in place. We'll 
do more complicated stuff later (see @sec-specification-2).

Parameters

- `CL`
- `V`
- `KA`

Compartments

- `CENT`
- `DEPOT`

## Where to save your code?

- You can use any file name with any extension
- The extension you use may influence how your editor highlights and 
  indents your code
- I use `.mod`


## Model specification blocks

Model components are coded into blocks, which are delineated by a 
specific block syntax. You have a couple of options

__NONMEM style__

These start with `$` and then the block name (`$PK`)

__Bracket style__

Put the block name in brackets (`[ ERROR ]`)

__Upper or lower case__

You can use either:

- `$error`
- `[ pk ]`
- etc ... they all work


### Syntax

The "type" of code you write will vary from block to block. 
Sometimes it is an R-like syntax and sometimes it is 
`c++` code. 

Don't worry if you don't know `c++`! We have taken a lot of 
the complexity out and with a handful of exceptions, the 
code should be pretty natural and similar to what you write
in R. 

We will show you more `c++` in chapters to come.

## Base model blocks

### Parameters

Use the `$PARAM` block header.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
$PARAM 
CL = 1, V = 20, KA = 1.1
```

Parameters have a **name** and a **value**, separated by `=`.

Parameter names can be upper or lower case. If you want punctuation, 
use underscore `_`.

Parameter values must _evaluate_ to numeric.

Parameters can't be functions of other parameters _when writing the `$PARAM` block_. But there is a place where you can do this ...
we'll see this later on.

Multiple parameters can go on one line, but separate by comma.



### Read it in with `mread()`

Point `mread()` at your model file to

- read in the model
- see if it compiles

```{r}
mod <- mread(here("model/simple.mod"))
```

We'll learn much more about `mread()` later on, but for now we need a way 
to check if our model coding is correct.


## Compartments

```{r, eval = FALSE}
$PARAM 
CL = 1, V = 20, KA = 1.1

$CMT DEPOT CENT
```

Compartments are named 

- Upper or lower case
- Punctuation use `_`

Order doesn't matter, except 

- When putting dosing records into the data set
- You want to use the NONMEM-style coding


## Differential equations

Now, we'll write ODE using `$DES` (or `$ODE`) block. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
$PARAM 
CL = 1, V = 20, KA = 1.1

$CMT DEPOT CENT

$DES
dxdt_DEPOT = -KA * DEPOT;
dxdt_CENT  =  KA * DEPOT - (CL/V)*CENT;
```

Left hand side is `dxdt_<compartment name>`. 

Right hand side can reference

- Compartments
- Parameters
- Other quantities derived in `$DES` or `$PK`
- Other internal variables

Unlike `$PARAM` and `$CMT`, this is `c++` code

- Any valid `c++` code is allowed
- Each line (statement) should end in semi-colon `;`

## Derived outputs

Like NONMEM, derived can be calculated in the `$ERROR` block.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
$PARAM 
CL = 1, V = 20, KA = 1.1

$CMT DEPOT CENT

$DES
dxdt_DEPOT = -KA * DEPOT;
dxdt_CENT  =  KA * DEPOT - (CL/V)*CENT;

$ERROR
double CP = CENT/V;
```

Like `$DES`, this block must be valid `c++` code. 

Here we have created a new variable called `CP`, which is 
the amount in the central compartment divided by the 
central volume of distribution. 

When we create a new variable, we must declare its `type`. 
Use `double` for a floating point number. 

## Capture outputs into the simulated data

`mrgsolve` has a `$CAPTURE` block that works like 
NONMEM's `$TABLE`. Just list the names you want copied
into the output.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
$PARAM 
CL = 1, V = 20, KA = 1.1

$CMT DEPOT CENT

$DES
dxdt_DEPOT = -KA * DEPOT;
dxdt_CENT  =  KA * DEPOT - (CL/V)*CENT;

$ERROR
double CP = CENT/V;

$CAPTURE CP
```

Rather than putting stuff in `$CAPTURE`, try declaring with type `capture`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
$ERROR
capture CP = CENT/V;
```

`capture` is identical to type `double`, but tells `mrgsolve` to include this 
item in the simulated output.


A little-use feature is renaming items in `$CAPTURE`

```{r}
#| eval: false
$ERROR 
double DV = CENT/V;

$CAPTURE CP = DV
```
